            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:100876:3"/> make a real, plain, and necessary contest, sets all a fire; yet to be silent, may not excuse by what you will find; a memorial then of our condition fairly drawn out is thought best, as the onely pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse for all loads and impetuous vapouring whatsoever, when expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth, that let the first fumes passe, and they easily come to nothing, whereas kindled by <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal opposition,</hi> they set all in a flame.</p>

            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Atheisme</hi> hath a deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest here, the same Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, saying, <hi>Though they professe God with their mouth, yet by their deeds they deny him;</hi> most apparent that a <hi>God</hi> at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,

Num. 20, 12, 13.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That some may fret and fume at this, and particularly at my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
<pb facs="tcp:100876:4"/> listing the nature and quality of transgressions here pointed at; first, in defence of my self, note well that of my self I say nothing to this purpose, being no other then a meer <hi>Amanuensis</hi> or Scribe to deliver what is dictated to me, and undeniably follows, and this out of <hi>Sacred Scripture,</hi> holy <hi>Fathers,</hi> and grave <hi>Authours.</hi> Will you that I modifie these with some qualification? God forbid, it were a high presumption indeed when I take not any of these to be drawn at pleasure, as Hereticks handle holy Scripture to sound ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their clapper what they list, that <hi>Luther</hi> shall term it a <hi>Nose of wax</hi> formed to any thing, worth nothing thus handled; wherefore faithfully delivered, let them also be faithfully understood, by some pious learned <hi>Prelate</hi> or grave <hi>Pastour,</hi> the sole <hi>Pillars</hi> of support and level of all modest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation assigned through this whole design.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:100876:5"/>
            <p>As for Murmurers then at such <hi>Catechistical</hi> documents, I wish them better advised, even for their own credits not to bewray so foul a tincture, as <hi>St. Hierome</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Hierome</note> noteth such, and pointed at by holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> where it expresseth such spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, saying, <hi>Let us oppresse the poor just man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Salomon</note>
               <hi>and not spare the Widow, nor reverence the old mans gray head of so long time. But let our strength be the Law of Justice; for that which is weak, is found unprofitable to us; Let us therefore circumvent the just, because he is unprofitable to us, and contrary to our works, and reproachfully objecteth unto us the sins of the Law, and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in us the sins of our Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi> Thus <hi>Solomon,</hi> and more at large through the whole Chapter of such animals spetting and fretting at wholsome counsel; yea, and with high contempt, when the Prophet <hi>Isai</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai.</note> shall relate them further, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb facs="tcp:100876:5"/>
               <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die:</hi> and what were these but Idolatrous <hi>Jews</hi> by the testimony of <hi>Moses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Moses</note> saying, <hi>The people sate down to eat and drink, and rose to play;</hi> such then as imitate this Libertine humour in so excessive a manner, may justly be ranked with them, and to close this exorbitant sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality,<note place="margin">S.

               </note>
               <hi>Am I become your enemy, telling you the truth?</hi> God forbid, rather say with <hi>King David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">K. David.</note> unto the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> reprehending him, <hi>I have sinned against our Lord,</hi> that so you may have his testimony, that your sinne is remitted. And say with him: <hi>The just will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and reprehend me in mercy</hi> (with sweetness out of charity) <hi>but</hi> the oil (or flattery) <hi>of sinners shall not anoint my head.</hi> Thus this
<pb facs="tcp:100876:6"/> great King and many others in Holy Writ all for our example to acknowledge &amp; correct vice, which if not better reflected upon, a sad doom will follow, <hi>[Sapient. cap. 2.10, 11, &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>But it is not much to be wondred at that man fails, when God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self shall say, <hi>The sense and cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mans heart are prone to ill from their youth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Genesis</note> wherefore some are highly to be blamed, that he is not visited, some for better understanding; others for true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of conscience, when S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
               </note> shall observe the worst condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a sinner to be <hi>obstinacy</hi> not to amend. But saith St <hi>Hierom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Hierome.</note>
               <hi>If bashfulnesse follow the fault, there is great hopes of Salvation.</hi> Reflect then upon the <hi>Psalmist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalmist</note> saying, <hi>You sons of men, how long are you of heavy</hi> (hardened) <hi>hearts? why love you vanity, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:100876:6"/> seek lying?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou hatest them that observe vanities.</hi> But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, I say with old <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertullian</note>
               <hi>I presume to write unto you, not out of affection</hi> (as flattery) <hi>but</hi> (out of charity) <hi>to provide for your affection in the way of your Salvation.</hi> Thus he, [<hi>Gen. 8.21.</hi> S. <hi>Cypr. here following</hi> worth noting, S. <hi>Hierom</hi> hereafter, p. <hi>139 Psal. 4.3. &amp; 30.7.

            <p>If any itching litigious Spirit exact the name of this <hi>Author,</hi> and particularly, because noted as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the <hi>Appendix</hi> here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, understand a real dispari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; in the <hi>Appendix</hi> all runs a full carrier, without any one au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick <hi>Abettor</hi> or solid Second in defence of what is highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.

               <p>
                  <hi>The pomps then of the Devil are said to be some things which are not alway sins; yet they either cause sin, or put a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to it by waiting on it, or follow it as the Devils preparation: Thus Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Fathers explicate it out of Holy Scripture.</hi> Thus he, and then relates divers, which for brevities sake I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, [<hi>ibid. p.</hi> 27. <hi>conclus.</hi> 1.]</p>
               <p>Again, saith he, <hi>It is certain that all those things computed amongst the pomps of the Devil, ordinarily and commonly are either provokers of sin, or nourishers of concupiscence, or impediments of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or seeds of Injustice.</hi> Thus he, [<hi>ib. pag.</hi> 29.]</p>
               <p>Now then to begin with the very primitive bane of all, and original motive of our first transgression, <hi>Pride,</hi> Mother of all vice, which as none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it to be a sin, so none will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, at least in themselves, how guilty soever: yet not too grosly to deceive our selves; let us a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon it, and in three particulars; As more immediate it concerns God,

               <p>But, say some; This we easily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, but what is the offence? if not <hi>mortal,</hi> we know how to deal with it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of Pride, in order unto God, with the offence.</note>To satisfie this, and first purely in order unto God, <hi>Lucifers</hi> rebellion may not be denied to be <hi>mortal,</hi> and in a high degree, as before; yea, not resting there, he ceased not until he had drawn us into the same pickle, when he had said to our mother <hi>Eve, God doth know, that in what day soever you shall eat thereof,</hi> (the forbidden fruit) <hi>your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil.</hi> This so inflamed the weak woman, that she did eat, and betraied her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to do the like; and why? out of <hi>Pride,</hi> to gain this knowledge not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, yea, proper onely unto God, but what proved it unto them? contrary to the suggestion, not of good, but ill, that sin seized upon them, to make them see their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, before that not conceived as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so, notwithstanding this reigned, and still reigneth in their posterity too <hi>mortal.</hi> Thus <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when he said, <hi>What God is there that shall

                  <hi>No man ever saw</hi> Martin <hi>angry, never sorrowful, never laughing, being always one and the same, carrying in his countenance as it were a coelestial joy; he had so great patience against all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that though a Bishop often abused by his inferiour Clergy, yet never punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any (for his particular) neither did he for this either put them out of their place, or repel them from his charity: there never sounded in his mouth, but Christ; never in his heart, but piety, but peace, but mercy; and often would weep for the sins of his Detractors.</hi> Thus he [<hi>Dial.</hi> 1. <hi>de vita Sancti Martini.</hi>]</p>
               <p>But some may say, this was a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and nothing to us: excuse me, though

                  <note place="margin">Of pride, in order to our selves.</note> precisely in order to our selves, let us first listen to the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> speaking of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and in that unto us, saith, <hi>This was the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity

                  <hi>Pride, fulnesse of bread, abundance, the idlenesse of her and her daughters, they stretched not their hand to the needy and poor; And they were elevated</hi> (in pride) <hi>and did abominations before me, and I took them away, as thou hast seen. And</hi> Samaria <hi>sinned not the half of thy sinnes.</hi> Thus the Prophet, and too full upon us, if noted but a little: As the first and original cause of the fiery destruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> was <hi>Pride;</hi> the second, <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> unto gluttony, with all luxurious sensuality; the third, abundance of riches, so dangerous, that saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Paul</hi>

               <p>Again, our Saviour saith, <hi>Wo to you Pharisees,</hi>

               <p>Again, this <hi>Pride,</hi> in order to our selves, hath this particular, to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to <hi>know,</hi> to be <hi>known,</hi> and vainly boast of impertinencies, which when vaunted with notable scandal, <hi>mortal</hi> sin cannot be far from it.

               <p>Let us then close with St. <hi>Austine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">S. <hi>Austine,</hi> of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> relating a remarkable example of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> in <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> of noble birth; who having by <hi>Socrates</hi> learned to know himself, and that in the main point of being no difference between him and a <hi>Porter;</hi> with tears he desired to be taught true vertue, which was this:

                  <hi>Know that thou art a man conceived in sin, born in misery, livest in pain, and of necessity must die: Be then careful what thou doest, and what thou oughtest to do:</hi> Thus he and both <hi>Heathens</hi> to the confusion of all <hi>Christians</hi> that make not better use of it, [S. <hi>August. lib.</hi> 13. <hi>de Civitat.

               <p>Thus you have a touch of <hi>Pride,</hi> which as every man condemns; so (I say) no man will acknowledge it; though as false in it self, so here in the very suggestion to our first <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> to what was expected, to be as <hi>Gods,</hi> when thus to participate with the <hi>Devil</hi> onely, in knowing ill by so fowl a transgression; that as soon as <hi>Adam</hi> saw his miserable condition, he blushed, and made himself clothes to cover that shame for our next point which must demonstrate the foulnesse of the <hi>Interiour</hi> disposition by an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour</hi> profession of it.</p>

To cover nakednesse, to defend from the weather, and for health; and to serve quality: Thus God would have Priests distinguished from the Laity; Kings, Princes and Magistrates from the Commons, and the Nobility from the vulgar. Yea in order to Religion, the Hebrewes were distinguished from the Gentiles, and finally Christians at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were by their habit distinguished from them both, as is manifest by all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, sacred and profane;</hi> saith he, <hi>[Ibid. pag.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>But to take our first <hi>Parents</hi> with us: When they (<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve) perceived themselves to be naked, they sowed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaves of a Fig-tree, and made themselves Aprons</hi> (to cover at least na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies more sensuall blush) which when God saw (to our capacity) he made Coats of skins, as more significant and proper for their use; but why would

A reason may be their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Penance,</hi> which howsoever now not reflected upon, we are in the same predicament still, and thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> who ever went clad much after the same memoriall, and why but for our example? But admit a larger liberty in some particular cases, as (I say) hereafter <hi>pag</hi> 86. yet still the ordinary must be contained within the List of a penitentiall condition, that is, decent, not elevating to <hi>Pride,</hi> nor animating to worse, which certainly is the end, at least, close of such prodigality, and the only cause why so condemned, as we read in the Prophet <hi>Isai,</hi> speaking first of the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> then of the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for the excessive <hi>Pride,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I answer</hi> (saith he) <hi>distinguishing the Major, that although the end of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, in respect of the party exceeding, and enormously adorning and vesting himself, be only vanity and boasting, yet as attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant they have necessarily others joyned with them: first, a most inordinate disposition against the condition of nature instituted, or also lapsed; for God gave garments for a covering of nature, a defence of health; but in this Case, whether man or woman, they transgresse all the Laws of Nature.</hi> Thus he, citing <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> as above, <hi>ibid.</hi> 34.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly, this excesse of ornaments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a contempt of God, which contempt Fathers thus exaggerate, that they seem to introduce another form upon that divine Image and form ordained by God: That they despise the threatnings of God contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Holy Scripture, equal to Divine Precepts.

               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:100876:62"/>
               <p>For our use of this: first, let us clear the Text, and our Conclusion will plainly follow: Some then may ask, What meaneth this first <hi>birth-right</hi> in the Law of <hi>Nature?</hi> I answer, besides that which is common and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to our eldest sonnes, as Honour, Dignity, and place in our publick meetings: First, they have a double portion in their Fathers inheritance: Secondly, a peculiar benediction of their dying <hi>Parent,</hi> of great power with God, and highly esteemed. Thirdly, the dignity of <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> which was so long due unto him as they lived together; for when one departed, to begin a new family, as he was made <hi>Head</hi> of that family, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Priest</hi> by right. Fourthly, the father of the family dying, the eldest succeeded in the same manner.</p>
               <p>But some may ask again, whether <hi>Esau</hi> sinned in selling his first <hi>birth-right,</hi> and how far? I answer; First, that he sinned in Gluttony, for that he saith, <hi>Lo I die;</hi> it was a false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to induce <hi>Jacob</hi> to his desire; for if he had truly wanted, his father <hi>Isaac,</hi> being very rich, could not want sufficient victuals, but his intemperate
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100876:62"/> appetite must covet <hi>Jacobs</hi> particular provision. Secondly, he sinned most irreligiously, in contemning a holy thing, the right of <hi>Priesthood,</hi> annexed to the first <hi>birth-right;</hi> that some say, he sinned by Simony, in selling a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth him <hi>Prophane Esau, [Hebr.</hi> 12.16.]</p>
               <p>Again, you may ask then, whether <hi>Jacob</hi> did not sin by Simony, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring and first moving this sale, and also, against justice, in buying so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious a thing at so base and low a rate? I answer, that he sinned in neither, for what he did, was by Gods divine Decree a little before, that the Elder should serve the Younger, that he did very well in taking this occasion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Gods particular providence and divine Will, by the expresse text of this whole Chapter. Neither may God be called to account, being Lord of all, with a most sacred and mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal disposing of all things above our reach, who are onely to learn and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Will of God. As for the <hi>Priesthood</hi> it is only an acccssory or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenance annexed to the first <hi>birth-right,</hi> &amp; no distinct inheritance other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of it self, more then is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100876:63"/> of the chief of the family, wherein yet prophane <hi>Esau</hi> may not be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from deriding and contemning both prophane and sacred things, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in point of Simony, when the Text concludes: <hi>Little esteeming, that he had sold his first birth-right.</hi> Thus <hi>Tirinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to our purpose of <hi>Feasting,</hi> and sensual appetite, it is too apparent in selling such gifts and priviledges at so base and sensual a rate, without all necessity: and so much of this.</p>

To whom also our Lord gave Beauty, because all this trimming did not depend of sensuality, but of vertue, and therefore our Lord amplified this Beauty on her, that she might appear to all mens eyes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable comlinesse.</hi> Thus the Text, [<hi>Exod. cap.</hi> 7.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. 28.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.6. <hi>Tirin. in</hi> Psal. 46.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> Psal, 81.1.6. Joan. 10.34. Numb. 11.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1. Reg. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. Judith. 10.3.]</p>
               <p>Now if this seem to animate the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of these dayes, there is a great mistake and a greater abuse: For first, that she had such rich ornaments, well she might, being noble both by Father and Husband; and in a decent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100876:70"/> though here set out to the height upon her particular calling by God to execute his will upon <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and this as the text noteth: <hi>Because all this trimming did not depend of sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but of vertue, that for it God am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified her beauty.</hi> whosoever then will pretend this example must give good assurance of the like divine calling, which I think few do, and fewer ever think of it: But for her common dressing, as more sutable to her quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the text saith; <hi>And Judith was left his</hi> (Manasses) <hi>widow now three years and six months, and in the higher part of her house, she made her self a secret cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in which she abode shut up with her maids, and having cloath of hair upon her loines, she fasted all the dayes of her life, but Sabbaths and New Moons</hi> (the first day of the moneth) <hi>and the feasts of the house of Israel, and she was of an exceeding beautiful countenance.</hi> Thus the Text, that what she did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is plain, by the expresse command of God, wherein she so far concurred that she said: <hi>Bring to passe, Lord, that his pride be cut off with his own sword. Let him</hi> (Holofernes) <hi>be caught with the snare of his eyes in me, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100876:70"/> thou shalt strike him from the lips of my charity.</hi> Thus this holy noble woman, in whom note her retirement, private prayers, wearing hair-cloth and much fasting, as the attire and condition of her Widow-hood: Also her note up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the danger of her Beauty sufficient after all to retire her to her former ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struce widow-course. Now if you take one part of the example to brave it, you ought necessarily to follow the other, to be a compleat Disciple, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising true <hi>Christian Discipline, [Jud. cap.</hi> 8.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 9.12.]</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding all this glory in the attire and beauty of so prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a person, laudably, yea, religiously admitted by us, and no lesse condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unworthily, assumed by others, unto whom they no way belong: I cannot but note one abomination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by this holy Princesse, which she might so easily have pretended, that is,<note place="margin">The abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of women assuming mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</note> to have clad her self in mans appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, upon some pretence or other, but it seems she had met with that text of <hi>Moses,</hi> saying: <hi>A woman shall not be clothed with mans apparel; neither shall man use womans apparel, for he is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable before God that doth these
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100876:71"/> things.</hi> Thus he; If thus, then, how come we so bold in these times; I mean not for some lawful urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, to avoid a greater eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but to live in it some time, and to wicked ends, yea perchance known and permitted?

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100876:71"/> monethly flowers; and were it not in the dayes of my silence.</hi> Thus she, for saith the text, <hi>she sought not womens ornaments, but whatsoever</hi> Egeus <hi>the Eunuch, the keeper of the Virgins would, those things he gave her to her adorning.</hi> Thus the Text, and most sufficient to our purpose [<hi>cap.</hi> 2.15. <hi>and</hi> 15 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 2.16. and 14.16.]</p>

               <p>But, say some, I must provide for adversity and hard times many wayes, which may excuse all this, or most part of it.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100876:94"/> there is no true providence, for who can withstand <hi>Gods</hi> holy will and pleasure, to punish such as transgresse these divine Texts, both of his own sacred word and Doctors upon them?

               <p>But where this prevailes not, the <hi>Devill</hi> presently assaults by <hi>Prosperity,</hi> that is, abundance, whether of his own, or at a secondhand by others, and this is most of all dangerous, that Saint <hi>Austine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">St. <hi>Austine.</hi>

                  <hi>That rich Glutton in the Gospel is said to have no other sinne, but that abounding in riches and wealth, he was elevated to that pride, that he would give nothing to poor hungry</hi> Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <hi>and so far forgetfull of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he would not give this poor wretch, what was throwne away;</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>They that will be made rich, fall into tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the snare of the Devill, and many desires unprofitable and hurtfull, which drown men into destruction and perdition; for the root of all evill is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse, which certain desiring, have erred from the faith, and have entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themselves in many sorrowes.</hi> Thus he not to be disputed, in oposition to his Letter.

               <p>To this it is easie to adde much more, which for brevities sake I omit; wherefore to give a period to all these extravagancies, let us more seriously lissen to <hi>Solomon,</hi> where he saith:<note place="margin">Proverbs.</note>

               <p>NOw then is all this <hi>Rhetorical</hi> and <hi>Hyperbolical?</hi> then no verity is to be understood; a word then of the effect of these exorbitancies upon a just account, with the stipend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted by the Prophet <hi>Isai,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai.</note> in the close of what you have heard out of him, pag. 18. his words are these: <hi>For sweet savours, there shall be stinks; for a girdle, a chord; for frisled Haire, bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and for a stomager, hair cloth. Thy fairest men shall fall by the sword, and thy strong ones in battell. And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall sit desolate on the ground.</hi> Thus he of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> wherein how our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> tears were verified is well known, though 40 years after his passion, when by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasianus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The effect of vain pleasure and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable riches.</note> besides incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible miseries by famine, and other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses there perished <hi>Eleven hundred thousand persons,</hi> and were taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, <hi>Ninty seven thousand;</hi> the siege also being in the very same feast, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100876:97"/> greatest solemnity of <hi>Easter,</hi> when they put our <hi>Saviour</hi> to death. [<hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41. and the <hi>English</hi> Note upon it in the Margent.]</p>
               <p>When the Text saith: <hi>After the Sonnes of God did company with the daughters of men, and they brought forth children, these are the mighty of the old world, famous men. And God seeing the malice of men was much on the earth, and that all the cogitations of their hearts were bent to ill at all times, it repented him that he had made man in the earth, and touched inwardly with sorrow of heart; I will saith he, clean take away man, whom I have created from the face of the earth.</hi> Thus holy Writ, whereupon followed <hi>Noes</hi> Flood, or Deluge, and for what not for <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> for there was none before the flood; not excesse in attire, or <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi> by any noted; it was for <hi>Pride,</hi> for <hi>Injustice,</hi> for <hi>sensual,</hi> yea <hi>bestial luxury;</hi> how applyable to our present times, I think it very impertinent to relate. [<hi>Genes.</hi> 6.4.]</p>
               <p>To this we might adde the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> in high terms against all rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous sensualities home to our times, but Saint <hi>Peter</hi> as at present, our more
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100876:98"/> proper <hi>Pastour,</hi> may suffice speaking of the sensuality of future ages, saith: <hi>These men as unreasonable beasts, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tending to the snare and destruction, in those things which they know not blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, shall perish in their corruption, receiving the reward of injustice, esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a pleasure the delights of a day: Coinquinations and spots, flowing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies, in their feastings, rioting with you; having eyes full of adultery, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant sin: alluring unstable soules, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their hearts exercised with avarice, the children of malediction: leaving the right way, they have erred, &amp;c. it had been better for them not to have known the way of justice, then after the knowledge of it, to turn back from it.</hi> Thus Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and how proper to our times, in many respect is easily conceived. [<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.47. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12, 21.]</p>
               <p>But some may say, St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks this (at least for the most part) to <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Jewes</hi> of his time, though now <hi>Christian,</hi> yet too much fettered in their former vitious courses; and if of <hi>Hereticks</hi> in future ages, what is that to us <hi>Catholicks,</hi> we run not into such excesses?

               <p>For answer to this; first, here is no token to <hi>paint the face,</hi> or any wayes in behalf of beauty, but to reprehend the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who when they fasted out of <hi>hypocrisie</hi> to vaunt of their <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting</hi> accomodated themselves in a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did nasty way justly reprehensible, when all concerning the face is to wash it without any particular water or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; for thus runs the Text, <hi>VVhen thou doest fast, anoint thy head, and wash thy face, that thou appear not to men to fast.</hi> Not a word of Beauty in any sence, but to passe in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hew, that the motive of this Ceremony was not intended by our <hi>Saviour materially,</hi> but <hi>mystically,</hi> that as these things made them look plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and cheerful, so they should do when they fasted now,<note place="margin">Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our Saviour</note> as <hi>Christians</hi> without them, saith St. <hi>Hilarius,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome, Theophylact,</hi> and <hi>Euthymius</hi> primitive and ancient Fathers, unto whom we might adde divers moderne grave Authours of quality; for to think that our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> would counsel them simply to <hi>paint</hi> and <hi>patch</hi> the face to advance Beauty, when they <hi>mortified</hi> themselves by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, were most absurd, yea <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,</hi>

But at length, finding by my greater experience in the world, that many, if not most women of more polished breeding, every way vertuous and most commendable for all worthy qualities, did use more or lesse (privately and it may be lesse discernably to vulgar eyes) something of art to retard age &amp; wrinkles, to preserve or recover a good complexion, to quicken that colour which is the life of the face, and to dispel the death of an excessive palenesse, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

               <p>Here you see a pretty spirit in a strong shaking fit of a professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Tradition;</hi> and whither then? he drawes all neerer home under his own proper verge, <hi>though so ponderous a cloud of witnesses against him,</hi> censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all, not fearing their names, how renowned soever, but the weight of their <hi>Reasons,</hi> and that least of all, when so tributary to his phansy, as not to budg without it, notwithstanding the <hi>Record</hi> of these names, most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for all abilities and piety in the <hi>Church of Christ, (even by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> hereafter) might daunt him, were he not delivered up, (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle notes some) <hi>into a reprobate sense.</hi> But how runs his reason? <hi>Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by my greater experience in the world, &amp;c.</hi> and what experience? still <hi>custome,</hi> and vulgar worldly <hi>custome,</hi> the high road noted in the Gospel sufficiently declared whither it tends, yea, two well known, and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intercepted already, which if not sufficient, but that such <hi>custome</hi> must

                  <hi>As the several censures and opinions of the Fathers must give way to the Scriptures authority (out of which nothing of validity is produceable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst auxiliary Beauty) so they may (without injury) be looked upon as farre inferiour to the joynt suffrages or resolves of Councels, without whose concurrence with the Fathers sense, I can hardly think any thing a sin or violation of that modesty required by Ecclesiastical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and the Discipline of ancient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> Thus he, p. 116.</p>

               <p>For answer to this, first, that all must issue out of holy Scripture, I conceive it sufficiently answered in our behalf already, before, but why may not he be exacted, for at least some rational colour out of <hi>Scripture</hi> for the support of any thing that he saith to the purpose in hand? but passe. That holy <hi>Fathers</hi> are to give way to <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is easily granted, but by whose better advice? not by any <hi>Heretick,</hi> not any single modern <hi>Doctour,</hi> much lesse every vulgar sick-brain; not any <hi>Ʋniversity</hi> or <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> in the least point not <hi>Passant</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> who then? I answer, the <hi>supream Pastour</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> with his <hi>Councel</hi> and this according to just reason. But what doth he oppose <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> to <hi>Scripture,</hi> when he hath not the least sentence out of <hi>Scripture</hi> in opposition?</p>
               <p>That <hi>Fathers</hi> ought to give way to <hi>Councels,</hi> make them Canonical, and it is easily granted, otherwise not; <hi>that he can hardly believe a sin declared by holy Fathers without a Councel,</hi> is very strange; first, in that I think he believes not many Councels, if the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100876:121"/> first four, according to Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Articles and Act of Parliament, he will not find many there declared more then for the <hi>consubstantiality</hi> of the son with the Father, keeping <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> and such like points of <hi>Faith,</hi> even silenced in holy Scripture, and but few, too short to reach to many other points, both of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> upon pain of sin to be observed; and no wonder, when nothing in any kind of this Nature was ever acted, or decreed, but as particular occasions urged; neither do <hi>Councels</hi> descend to the particulars of a <hi>compleat Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme,</hi> even in point of <hi>sin,</hi> leaving that to the <hi>Supream Pastour</hi> and his Doctours appointed by our <hi>Saviour</hi> to that purpose, witnesse his <hi>Apostle,</hi> as before, and not as this Doctor <hi>Patch</hi> closeth Councels in point of these exorbitancies, saying: <hi>Leaving them to the freedome of every one,</hi>

               <p>But saith he, <hi>I find no woman (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise unblameable) either censured or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for her colouring and dressing.

               <p>To this I answer, that for censuring by any ancient <hi>Confessors</hi> or <hi>Casuists,</hi> I refer you to the primitive <hi>Fathers</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, I hope both holy <hi>Confessours</hi> and solid <hi>Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>How absurd this is, let any rational man judge, when it absolutely annuls all prodigality in apparel, and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive dressings for nothing <hi>ex diametro,</hi> against all Christian Discipline, as you have heard, even belying the silence of holy Scripture, and for Councels sufficiently testified by their Doctors produced, especially when all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels Orthodox whatsoever, are silent in noting them for any errour, at least in this.</p>

               <p>For answer to this: first, of sin in any colour, silks, cloth of gold, &amp;c. in it self or the materials, is too absurd to be noted, as most ridiculous, but the use and abuse of them, as here where no authentick proof at all of <hi>yellow</hi> or <hi>blue starch</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, appeareth, but the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it, and deservedly as a gross vanity and fulsome pride never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by any Orthodox grave <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour;</hi> And for the note of <hi>Jesuits</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bands, it is so false, that in their habit they use none at all, and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conditions they passe with other civil men.
